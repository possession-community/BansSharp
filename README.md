## Build

1. clone this repository.

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on [`.env.example`](./.env.example).

4. Push the schema to your database with drizzle-kit:

‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful not to delete any other tables, as choosing Yes in the Drizzle dialog will delete the tables and their data.

   ```bash
   pnpm db push
   ```

5. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev

## Issue watchlist

- [React Compiler docs](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler), [Working Group](https://github.com/reactwg/react-compiler/discussions) - React Compiler is still in beta. You can disable it in [app.config.ts](./app.config.ts#L15) if you prefer.
- https://github.com/TanStack/router/discussions/2863 - TanStack Start is currently in beta and may still undergo major changes.
- https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/discussions/6714 - We're using the `canary` version of shadcn/ui for Tailwind v4 support.

## Auth

Better Auth is currently configured for email/password authentication, but can be easily modified to use other providers.

Here is how to create root account.

1. Sign-In with Steam authentication
2. In server console, type `pnpm change-role <your_STEAM_ID> root`
3. Reload the browser, done. You can manage any users in Settings page.

## Goodies

#### Scripts

These scripts in [package.json](./package.json#L5) use **pnpm** by default, but you can modify them to use your preferred package manager.

- **`auth:generate`** - Regenerate the [auth db schema](./lib/server/schema/auth.schema.ts) if you've made changes to your Better Auth [config](./lib/server/auth.ts).
- **`db`** - Run drizzle-kit commands. (e.g. `pnpm db generate` to generate a migration)
- **`ui`** - The shadcn/ui CLI. (e.g. `pnpm ui add button` to add the button component)
- **`format`** and **`lint`** - Run Prettier and ESLint.

## Building for production

Read the [hosting docs](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/hosting) for information on how to deploy your TanStack Start app.
